                <p>TALTZ (ixekizumab (rch)) is a humanised immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal
                    antibody (mAb) with neutralising activity against interleukin-17A (IL-17A). TALTZ is
                    produced by recombinant DNA technology in a recombinant mammalian cell line and
                    purified using standard technology for bioprocessing. Ixekizumab is comprised of two
                    identical light chain polypeptides of 219 amino acids each and two identical heavy chain
                    polypeptides of 445 amino acids each.</p>

                <h4 id="Therapeutic_indications">4.1 Therapeutic indications </h4>
                <p><b>Plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy</p>
                <p><b>Psoriatic arthritis</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have
responded inadequately, or who are intolerant, to previous DMARD therapy.</p>
                <p>TALTZ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with a conventional DMARD (e.g.
methotrexate).</p>

                <h4 id="Dose_and_method_of_administration">4.2 Dose and method of administration </h4>

                <p><b>Dosage</b></p>
                <p><b>Plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>The recommended dose is 160 mg by SC injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed
by an 80 mg injection (one injection) every 2 weeks at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, then 80 mg
(one injection) every 4 weeks.</p>
                <p><b>Psoriatic arthritis</b></p>
                <p>The recommended dose is 160 mg by SC injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed
by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks. </p>
                <p>For psoriatic arthritis patients with coexistent moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, use the
dosing regimen for plaque psoriasis.</p>
                <p><b>Elderly patients (≥65 years)</b></p>
                <p>No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients.</p>
                <p><b>Renal impairment or hepatic impairment</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ has not been studied in these patient populations. No dosage recommendations can
be made.</p>
                <p><b>Method of administration</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is for SC injection. After training in SC injection technique, a patient may self-inject
with ixekizumab.</p>
                <p>If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites.</p>
                <p>TALTZ is for single-use in one patient only. Discard any residue product.</p>
                <p><b>Special precautions for handling</b></p>
                <p>The Instructions for Use included as a pack insert must be followed carefully.</p>
                <p>Do not use TALTZ if it has been frozen.</p>
                
                
                <h4 id="Contraindications">4.3 Contraindications </h4>
                <p>TALTZ is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ixekizumab or
any of the excipients.</p>

                <h4 id="Special_warnings_and_precautions_for_use">4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use </h4>
                <p><b>Infections</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ may increase the risk of infections. In clinical trials, a higher rate of infection such as
upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis and tinea infections were
observed in TALTZ treated patients compared to placebo <b>(see 4.8 Adverse effects
(Undesirable Effects)).</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic or active
infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an
infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard
therapy the patient should be closely monitored. TALTZ should be discontinued until the
infection resolves.</p>
                
                <p>Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ. Do
not administer TALTZ to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB
prior to administering TALTZ. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of TALTZ in
patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment
cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and
symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
                </p>

                <p><b>Hypersensitivity</b></p>
                <p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and
urticaria, have been reported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of
TALTZ should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.</p>
                <p><b> Inflammatory bowel disease</b></p>
                <p>Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater
frequency in the TALTZ group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than the
placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period of the psoriasis clinical
trials.</p>
                <p>Exercise caution when prescribing TALTZ to patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as new cases or exacerbations have been
reported. Patients treated with TALTZ and have inflammatory bowel disease should be
monitored closely.</p>
                <p><b>Immunisations</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live
vaccines.</p>
                <p>In a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified following administration of
inactivated vaccines (tetanus and pneumococcal) after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg
followed by a second dose of 80 mg two weeks later). However, there is insufficient data on
whether the immune response to these vaccines is adequate following administration of
TALTZ.</p>
                
                <p><b>Use in the elderly </b></p>
                <p>Of the 4204 psoriasis patients exposed to TALTZ in clinical trials, a total of 265 patients were
aged ≥65 years and 34 patients were aged ≥75 years. Of the 1118 PsA patients exposed to
TALTZ in clinical trials, a total of 122 patients were aged ≥65 years and 6 patients were aged
≥75 years. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and
younger patients, the number of patients aged ≥65 years is not sufficient to determine
whether they respond differently from younger patients. <b>(See 5.2 Pharmacokinetic
properties, Special Populations, Elderly Patients (≥65 years)).</b></p>
                <p><b>Paediatric use</b></p>
                <p>Safety and effectiveness of TALTZ in paediatric patients (Less than 18 years of age) have not been
evaluated.</p>
                <p><b>Effects on laboratory tests</b></p>
                <p>No information on the effect of ixekizumab on laboratory tests is available.</p>


                <h4 id="Interactions_with_other_medicines_and_other_forms_of_interactions">4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions</h4>
                <p>No interaction studies have been conducted with TALTZ.</p>
                <p>The safety of ixekizumab in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or
phototherapy has not been evaluated.</p>
                <p><b>Cytochrome P450 Substrates</b></p>
                <p>Results from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis
determined that administration of ixekizumab with drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 (ie
midazolam), CYP2C9 (ie warfarin), CYP2C19 (ie omeprazole), CYP1A2 (ie caffeine) or
CYP2D6 (ie dextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the
pharmacokinetics of these drugs.</p>
                <p>No interaction was seen when TALTZ was administered concomitantly with methotrexate
and/or corticosteroids in patients with psoriatic arthritis</p>
                


                <h4 id="Fertility_pregnancy_and_lactation">4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h4>
                <p><b>Effects on fertility </b></p>
                <p>The effects of ixekizumab on human fertility have not been evaluated. In animal studies,
ixekizumab did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility as assessed by a lack of
effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm in sexually mature cynomolgus
monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly SC dose of 50 mg/kg (at least 50
times the human exposure at 80 mg every 2 weeks based on AUC). The monkeys were not
mated to evaluate fertility.</p>

                <h4><b>Use in pregnancy</b></h4>
                <p>Category C</p>
                
                <p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies of TALTZ in pregnant women to establish
the safety of TALTZ during pregnancy. The mechanism of action of ixekizumab suggests a
theoretical risk that its use during pregnancy may affect neonatal immunity.</p>
                <p>In developmental toxicity studies, SC administration of ixekizumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg
once weekly to cynomolgus monkeys from the beginning of organogenesis through either
near term pregnancy or until delivery of offspring, produced no embryotoxicity or
teratogenicity, and no effects on offspring delivery, or on morphological, functional or
immunological development of offspring from birth to 6 months of age. Ixekizumab was
shown to cross the placenta and was present in the blood of offspring for up to 6 months of
age.</p>
                <p>TALTZ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
risk to the foetus.</p>

                <p><b>Use in lactation </b></p>
                <p>It is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after
ingestion. In a pre-/postnatal development study, ixekizumab was excreted at low levels in
the milk of cynomolgus monkeys that had been dosed with ixekizumab during pregnancy
until delivery of offspring. Ixekizumab was present in the blood of offspring, due primarily to
placental transfer. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to
discontinue TALTZ, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the
benefit of therapy for the woman.</p>

                <p>There are no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines associated with the use of
TALTZ.</p>

                <h4 id="Adverse_effects_Undesirable_effects">4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)</h4>
                <p><b>Clinical trials experience in plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>A total of 4204 plaque psoriasis patients were treated with TALTZ in clinical trials. Of these,
2190 patients were exposed to treatment with TALTZ for at least one year. </p>
                <p>Three placebo-controlled phase III trials (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3) in
plaque psoriasis patients were integrated to evaluate the safety of TALTZ in comparison to
placebo up to 12 weeks. In two of the clinical trials (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the safety
of TALTZ included a comparison to an active comparator, etanercept, up to 12 weeks after
treatment initiation <b>(see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Mechanism of Action,
Clinical Trials, Plaque Psoriasis)</b>. In total, 3858 patients were evaluated (1167 to TALTZ 80
mg every 2 weeks [Q2W], 1161 to TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W], 739 to etanercept 50
mg twice weekly group and 791 to placebo group).</p>
                <p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions and upper
respiratory tract infections (most frequently nasopharyngitis). Most of the reactions were
mild or moderate in severity.</p>
                <p>Adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TALTZ
groups compared to the placebo group during the placebo-controlled 12 week period of
UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 are summarised in Table 1.</p>
                
                    <img id="image" src="/test-site/test-site/taltz-pi/images/table1.png" alt="Table 1">⁨ 
                <p>Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the placebo-controlled clinical trials
UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 through to week 12 included: influenza, rhinitis,
conjunctivitis, urticaria and oral candidiasis.</p>
                <p>In the two clinical trials that included etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the rate of
serious adverse events was 1.9% for both etanercept and TALTZ, and the rate of
discontinuation due to adverse events was 1.2% for etanercept and 2.0% for TALTZ. The rate
of infections was 21.5% for etanercept and 26.0% for TALTZ, with the majority of events
being mild to moderate in severity. The rate of serious infections was 0.4% for etanercept
and 0.5% for TALTZ.</p>
                <p><b>Injection site reactions</b></p>
                <p>The most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions
were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of
TALTZ.</p>
                <p><b>Infections</b></p>
                <p>The majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate adverse reactions
such as nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, which did not necessitate
treatment discontinuation.</p>
                <p>In the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, infections
were reported in 27.2% of patients treated with TALTZ compared with 22.9% of patients
treated with placebo.</p>
                <p>Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6%) patients treated with TALTZ and in 3 (0.4%)
patients treated with placebo <b>(see 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use,
Infections)</b>. Infection-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported by more than 1 patient
in the TALTZ treated group were cellulitis (n=3), appendicitis (n=2) and erysipelas (n=2). </p>
                <p>The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an infection related adverse reaction
was similar in the total TALTZ treated group (n=8 [0.3%]) and the placebo group (n=2
[0.3%]).</p>
